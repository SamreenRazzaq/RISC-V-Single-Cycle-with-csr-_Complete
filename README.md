# RISC-V-Single-Cycle-with-csr-_Complete
This project implements a RISC-V processor using a single-cycle architecture. Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle, and the design includes Control and Status Registers (CSR) for managing system-level control and status. The CSR trap is hard-wired to handle exceptions.
